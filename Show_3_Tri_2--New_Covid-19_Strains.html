<body><div class="page"><h1 class="title">New Covid-19 Strains</h1><br/>Purpose: To inform the student body about the mutated Sars-COV virus<br /><br />1. Interviews:<br />   1) Cody Regional Health Expert<br />   2) Matt Lyman<br />      1- lyman2@llnl.gov<br />      2- (925) 424-2039<br />      3- 1993 CHS Grad<br />      4- Virologist at Lawrence Livermore Labs<br />2. Questions:<br />   ◇ How does a virus mutate?<br />   ◇ How different are these new variants?<br />   ◇ What are the main ways to prevent against getting these or the original covid-19 virus?<br />   ◇ Where are these strains most prevalent?<br />   ◇ Are there any mutated strains in the US today?<br />   ◇ What does the future look like regarding going into lockdown again?<br />   ◇ <strong>Should we be worried about the new Covid-19 variants?</strong><br />   ◇ Is it possible that we will need to go into lockdown again?<br />   ◇ Are these new variants more potent or dangerous?<br />   ◇ Why do viruses like covid-19 mutate?<br />   ◇ How is this going to affect school and/or our community as a whole?<br />   ◇ Seeing as how we just got out of lockdown, do you think that we are better prepared to handle something like this?<br />4. Sources:<br />   1) <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/transmission/variant.html,">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/transmission/variant.html</a>, Jan 15, 2021<br />      1- There are three main strains circulating globally:<br />         1&gt; “In the United Kingdom (UK), a new variant called B.1.1.7 has emerged with an unusually large number of mutations. This variant spreads more easily and quickly than other variants. Currently, there is no evidence that it causes more severe illness or increased risk of death. This variant was first detected in September 2020 and is now highly prevalent in London and southeast England. It has since been detected in numerous countries around the world, including the United States and Canada.”<br />         2&gt; “In South Africa, another variant called 1.351 has emerged independently of the variant detected in the UK. This variant, originally detected in early October, shares some mutations with the variant detected in the UK. There have been cases caused by this variant outside of South Africa, but it has not been detected in the US.”<br />         3&gt; "In Brazil, a variant called P.1 emerged and was identified in four travelers from Brazil, who were tested during routine screening at Haneda airport outside Tokyo, Japan. This variant contains a set of additional mutations that may affect its ability to be recognized by antibodies. This variant has not been detected in the US."<br />      2- “These variants seem to spread more easily and quickly than other variants, which may lead to more cases of COVID-19. Currently, there is no evidence that these variants cause more severe illness or increased risk of death. However, an increase in the number of cases will put more strain on health care resources, lead to more hospitalizations, and potentially more deaths.”<br />   2) <a href="https://www.webmd.com/lung/news/20210107/new-covid-super-strains-could-disrupt-life-again,">https://www.webmd.com/lung/news/20210107/new-covid-super-strains-could-disrupt-life-again</a>, Jan 7, 2021<br />      1- “The strains are about 50% more contagious than the virus that has been most widely circulating in the United States, though it doesn’t seem to be more fatal for any one person who catches it.”<br />      2- “Kucharski recently compared how many people would die after 10,000 new infections over the course of a month. With the current situation, with a virus that sees each patient infect an average of 1.1 others and kills .08% of everyone it infects, you’d predict 129 deaths over a month of spread. With a virus that’s 50% more deadly, you would expect to see about 193 deaths over a month of spread. With a virus that’s 50% more contagious, you end up with 978 more deaths over a month of spread -- or five times as many deaths.”</div></body></html>
