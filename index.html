										<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello, my name is William Lafayette Strong, today I was inducted as the governor of New York. I am happy to have this chance at creating a change in the nation no matter how small, I plan to create many reforms in order to better acoomodate to the city's needs. I'm only a governor, I would rather have been	a congressman, but this will have to do. I plan to create a better department of correction, which won't be hard since there is barely any sort of organization when it comes to that department.</p>
										<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also have very slight suspicion about the corruption inside the police department, I am currently looking into appointing someone trustworthy to deal with the situation. Obviously my first priorty at the moment is Tammany Hall, one of the worst human beings I know, but smart nonetheless. Hall has been usurped several times but with so many people in his pocket(the police department as an example) he just seems to always come back with more tricks up his sleeve each time</p>
										<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The commitee of Seventy are the ones who have put me in the place I am currently in, without them I would've never even though about running for governor, but when they approached me with the promise of a fusion ticket as long as I supported their ideals, which are very honorable by the way, I was ecstatic.</p>

										<h4><i>Sidenote</i></h4>
										<p><i>Strong was put into an imnpossible position to fix the corruptiuon inside the New York government, and he somehow was able to completely turn the city around, putting it inot a sort of "Golden Age" while he was in office, the worst part is that he was too late, as soon as he left office the power went straight back to the people that he was trying to fight. This undid a lot of the things that Strong had fought so much for.</i></p>
									</div>
									<div class="col-sm-9 col-xs-12">
										<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my past two years as governor I have, I would like to belive, created change. The political corruption in the city is far less and the streets of New York have never looked better, the trash has been picked up, the money is finally being reinvested into the people, not into the pockets of corrupt politicians, I believe that the city is now better off because of me. The police department is now back on track and all of the corrupt leaders have been rightly dealt with, Theodore Roosevelt is now the police commisioner and is making the department much more professional.</p>
										<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also was able to pass the School Reform law, this law pushed education in the city to finally be centralized everywhere instead of it being jurisdicted by local city wards. That is probably the last of the good news, the city is going to be consolidated, and while I think that is a good thing for the city, the person next in line is most definintely not. Robert Van Wyck is next in line, and has been hand-picked by none other than Tammany Hall himself. All that I've worked for is about to go down the drain, as soon as he is appointed, Hall will yet again have full control over the city and more importantly, the finances of the city.</p>

										<p>William Lafayette Strong is a very inspiring character, showing an excellent example of political reforms during the Progressive era. he was the reason for many of the reforms in New York City, like appointing Roosevelt as police commisioner changed the police scene in the city for the better. As Wikipedia states, "The reform-minded Strong established the New York City Board of Education, created small parks, and is credited as the "father" of the city's Department of Correction. The Department of Public Charities and Correction had been split by Governor Levi Morton in 1894 into two departments. Strong appointed former U.S. Civil Service Commissioner Theodore Roosevelt as Police Commissioner. Roosevelt was noted for fighting corruption and making the police department more professional."</p>
									</div>
									<div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-12">
										<p>Strong was one of, if not the most integral part to political reforms in New York City, the city was decresing at such a rate that Strong and his cabinet are probably one of the many reasons why the city thrives so well today. With his help, the "swamp" of New York City was drained. The downfall of his time in office was that he just couldn't do enough, he was the last unconsolidated governor, and directly afterwards Tammany Hall was able to appoint one of his own and was able to undo most of Strong's efforts.</p>
